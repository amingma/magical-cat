- Write a python script that is able to automatically regenerate Riot
  API key after every ~24 hours (Selenium)
- Figure out how to replace existing API key with this new one

- React frontend using axios to fetch data from Riot API
- Maybe get match history and allow user to paginate through matches while looking at 
  team, opponent, and overall statistics

- start by keeping a database with gamename, tagline, puuid, summonerid, and rank w/ rank as only publically displayable
